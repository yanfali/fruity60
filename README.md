## The Fruity60 Keyboard

A 60% PCB compatible with the [Adafruit Bluefruit BLE 32u4](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Feather-32u4-Bluefruit-LE-PCB).

Only supports 1 layout (tsangan), PCB mounted switches.

Primarily designed for fun, to learn [KICAD](http://www.kicad.org/)
and give back to the keyboard community in educational material.
If you find this design useful, I ask you to please
[donate](https://donorbox.org/qmk) to [QMK](https://qmk.fm), as it is the
amazing community and enthusiastic support of it's members that
helped me to design this.
